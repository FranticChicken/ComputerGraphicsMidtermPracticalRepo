Part 1: 

As my unity project is based on Excitebike, I created a bike and a ramp that the bike would theoretically drive up. I also added a capsule to represent the bike rider.

Part 2:

The toon shader makes most sense to be put on the bike since we are going for a more retro game look. My toon shader script is based off the lecture 5 slides shader script. It works by defining a colour and a texture in the properties. Then the LightingToonRamp function uses the dot product of the source and light direction to set the diffuse lighting.

Part 4: 
For the Rim script, I based it off of the lecture 5 rim lighting script. I used the rim lighting affect on the player to bring some contrast from the retro vibe of the motorcycle. This would work well as we are making a new version of Excitebike and bringing players a new artistic twist to the classic.
